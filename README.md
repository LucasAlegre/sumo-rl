# SUMO-RL

<!-- start intro -->

SUMO-RL provides a simple interface to instantiate Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments with [SUMO](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo) for Traffic Signal Control.

Goals of this repository:
- Provide a simple interface to work with Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control using SUMO
- Support Multiagent RL
- Compatibility with gymnasium.Env and popular RL libraries such as [stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/main/rllib.html)
- Easy customisation: state and reward definitions are easily modifiable

The main class is [SumoEnvironment](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/env.py).
If instantiated with parameter 'single-agent=True', it behaves like a regular [Gymnasium Env](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium).
For multiagent environments, use [env](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/env.py) or [parallel_env](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/env.py) to instantiate a [PettingZoo](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo) environment with AEC or Parallel API, respectively.
[TrafficSignal](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/traffic_signal.py) is responsible for retrieving information and actuating on traffic lights using [TraCI](https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI) API.

## Install

<!-- start install -->

### Install SUMO latest version:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sumo/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc
```
Don't forget to set SUMO_HOME variable (default sumo installation path is /usr/share/sumo)
```bash
echo 'export SUMO_HOME="/usr/share/sumo"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Important: for a huge performance boost (~8x) with Libsumo, you can declare the variable:
```bash
export LIBSUMO_AS_TRACI=1
```
Notice that you will not be able to run with sumo-gui or with multiple simulations in parallel if this is active ([more details](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Libsumo.html)).

### Install SUMO-RL

Stable release version is available through pip
```bash
pip install sumo-rl
```

Alternatively, you can install using the latest (unreleased) version
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl
cd sumo-rl
pip install -e .
```

<!-- end install -->

## MDP - Observations, Actions and Rewards

### Observation

<!-- start observation -->

The default observation for each traffic signal agent is a vector:
```python
    obs = [phase_one_hot, min_green, lane_1_density,...,lane_n_density, lane_1_queue,...,lane_n_queue]
```
- ```phase_one_hot``` is a one-hot encoded vector indicating the current active green phase
- ```min_green``` is a binary variable indicating whether min_green seconds have already passed in the current phase
- ```lane_i_density``` is the number of vehicles in incoming lane i dividided by the total capacity of the lane
- ```lane_i_queue```is the number of queued (speed below 0.1 m/s) vehicles in incoming lane i divided by the total capacity of the lane

You can define your own observation by implementing a class that inherits from [ObservationFunction](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/observations.py) and passing it to the environment constructor.

<!-- end observation -->

### Action

<!-- start action -->

The action space is discrete.
Every 'delta_time' seconds, each traffic signal agent can choose the next green phase configuration.

E.g.: In the [2-way single intersection](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/experiments/dqn_2way-single-intersection.py) there are |A| = 4 discrete actions, corresponding to the following green phase configurations:

</p>

Important: every time a phase change occurs, the next phase is preeceded by a yellow phase lasting ```yellow_time``` seconds.

<!-- end action -->

### Rewards

<!-- start reward -->

The default reward function is the change in cumulative vehicle delay:

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/_static/reward.png" align="center" width="25%"/>
</p>

That is, the reward is how much the total delay (sum of the waiting times of all approaching vehicles) changed in relation to the previous time-step.

You can choose a different reward function (see the ones implemented in [TrafficSignal](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/traffic_signal.py)) with the parameter `reward_fn` in the [SumoEnvironment](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl/blob/main/sumo_rl/environment/env.py) constructor.

It is also possible to implement your own reward function:

```python
def my_reward_fn(traffic_signal):
    return traffic_signal.get_average_speed()

env = SumoEnvironment(..., reward_fn=my_reward_fn)
```

<!-- end reward -->

## API's (Gymnasium and PettingZoo)

### Gymnasium Single-Agent API

<!-- start gymnasium -->

If your network only has ONE traffic light, then you can instantiate a standard Gymnasium env (see [Gymnasium API](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/)):
```python
import gymnasium as gym
import sumo_rl
env = gym.make('sumo-rl-v0',
                net_file='path_to_your_network.net.xml',
                route_file='path_to_your_routefile.rou.xml',
                out_csv_name='path_to_output.csv',
                use_gui=True,
                num_seconds=100000)
obs, info = env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
    next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
    done = terminated or truncated
```

<!-- end gymnasium -->

### PettingZoo Multi-Agent API

<!-- start pettingzoo -->

For multi-agent environments, you can use the PettingZoo API (see [Petting Zoo API](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/api/parallel/)):

```python
import sumo_rl
env = sumo_rl.parallel_env(net_file='nets/RESCO/grid4x4/grid4x4.net.xml',
                  route_file='nets/RESCO/grid4x4/grid4x4_1.rou.xml',
                  use_gui=True,
                  num_seconds=3600)
observations = env.reset()
while env.agents:
    actions = {agent: env.action_space(agent).sample() for agent in env.agents}  # this is where you would insert your policy
    observations, rewards, terminations, truncations, infos = env.step(actions)
```

<!-- end pettingzoo -->
